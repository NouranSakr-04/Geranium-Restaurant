        <p> The restaurant is situated on the 8th floor in Fælledparken (Common Gardens) in the center of Copenhagen,<br> from where one can follow the seasons' journey through the tree crowns, <br>catch glimpses of the city's green copper roofs and just see the windmills of Oeresund.

            <br>The location emphasizes Geranium's vision of gastronomic clarity and diversity.<br> We explore the area of tension between the urbane and the natural.<br></p>
        <p>Geranium invites guests to taste nature while simultaneously observing it around them. <br>The locally-inspired, seasonally-changing ‘Universe’ tasting menu takes place over a minimum<br> of three hours with around 20 courses split evenly between appetisers, savoury dishes and sweets.<br> Since making Geranium the first Danish restaurant to win three Michelin stars in 2016,<br> co-owners Rasmus Kofoed and Søren Ledet have never rested on their laurels, <br>keeping it fresh and exciting for regulars and destination diners alike.<br> In 2022 they reach the zenith of their careers, with Geranium named The World’s Best Restaurant,<br> sponsored by S.Pellegrino & Acqua Panna.</p>

       <h3><strong><center>Chef Rasmus Kofoed: The Vegetable King</center></strong></h3>
<p><strong>RAMSUS KOFOED</strong>: <br>a co-owner and a headchef and a star chef of three Michelin-starred Geranium in Copenhagen. <br> He is influencing an entire generation of young chefs to <br>feel confident in offering haute cuisine based on strictly vegetarian principles.<br> During the pandemic, he temporarily opened Angelika, a restaurant within Geranium,<br> with a wholly plant-based menu.</p>
    <br><h4 ><b>Chef's Inspirations For The New Menu</b></h4>
    
    <p>Kofoed has never backed down from a challenge,<br> after reaching the upper echelons of the World’s 50 Best Restaurant list last year, <br>second only to fellow Copenhagen restaurant Noma,<br> he decided to rework the restaurant menu,<br> the interior and the experience to make something fresh,<br> more authentic and closer to the passions that drive him.<br>“The inspiration comes from reaching out to life, the life that surrounds me at the moment.” Chef Kofoed said. </p>
